# GAHM
Game About Heuristic Mazes


## The Team
- Adam Worley
- Callum Harrod

###Aims
- Our aim is to create a fairly basic game built upon C++ and OpenGL.
- We intend to include python bindings to simplify the game engine.
- The end goal will be a game with not just basic gameplay mechanics such as movement and camera controls but also mechanics specific to our game.
- To build and run the game on the three major platforms.
- Include automated building or exectuable.
- Include AI with path finding etc...

###Objectives
- Build upon the basic code base provided.
- Include more advanced shaders and shapes.
- Develop multiple levels (Possibly through level loading or procedurally generated).
- Generate executable/makefile.

## Project Pitch

We intend to develop a 3D Wompas world esque game using C++ and openGL. The game will consist of maps that are randomly generated from a text file, which will allocate the size of the map, enemies and enemy difficulty.

### Timeline and milestones


### How to meet objectives

---

## Project Plan

##### Core Voxel Engine

- [ ] C++ base.
- [ ] openGL base.

##### Artificial intelligent agents
- [ ] Create the AI for the enemy character.
- [ ] Generate Pathfinding Algorithms.

- [ ] Use python bindings for the user game engine.

## Proposed Technologies
We will be using C++, OpenGL, !..!; Building on all 3 major platforms (Windows, OSx, Linux) while devloping on OSx.

## Marking Scheme

####Basic percentage breakdown
25% For basic game that we had last semester with improvements.

20% For using python.

15% For having a good makefile/exe.

15% Advanced texturing and game design.

10% For git usage.

10% For documentation.

5% Our panache.
