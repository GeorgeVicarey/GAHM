# GAHM
Game About Heuristic Mazes

## The Team
- Adam Worley
- Callum Harrod

### Aims
- Our aim is to create a fairly basic game built upon C++ and OpenGL.
- We intend to include lua bindings to simplify the game engine.
- The end goal will be a game with not just basic gameplay mechanics such as movement and camera controls but also mechanics specific to our game.
- To build and run the game on the three major platforms.
- Include automated building or executable.
- Include AI with path finding etc...

### Objectives
- Build upon the basic code base provided.
- Include more advanced shaders and shapes.
- Develop multiple levels (Possibly through level loading or procedurally generated).
- Generate executable/makefile.

## Project Pitch

We intend to develop a 3D Wompas world esque game using C++ and openGL.
The game will consist of maps that are randomly generated from a text file, which will allocate the size of the map,
enemies and enemy difficulty.

### Timeline and milestones

- week 6: By this time we plan on having a working engine, which allows us to render multiple cubes in the game world.
- week 8: By this time we are planning to have the lua bindings for the game.
- week 10: By this time we are planning on having the AI included within the game, to allow for good gameplay.
- week 12: By this time we aim to have the finished product, which would include tweaking, asthetic changes, and building the final game.

### How to meet objectives

To meet our objectives we are planning on using the program trelo to set goals and make sure we achieve them. We are also going to constantly using git to manage the game from anywhere we are. Luckily we both live in the same house so we can constantly work on the game together to make sure it is to the best possible standard.

We are also going to be heavily reading into some OpenGL, C++ and lua books. Luckily we have access to all of them and this combined with tutorials and articles online will help incredibly.

Using all the methods above should help us to completely finish our game to the best possible standards.

## Project Plan

##### Core Voxel Engine

- [ ] C++ base.
- [ ] openGL base.

##### Artificial intelligent agents

- [ ] Create the AI for the enemy character.
- [ ] Generate Pathfinding Algorithms.

- [ ] Use lua bindings for the user game engine.

## Proposed Technologies
We will be using C++, OpenGL, !..!; Building on all 3 major platforms (Windows, OSx, Linux) while developing on OSx.

## Marking Scheme

#### Basic percentage breakdown

25% For basic game that we had last semester with improvements.

20% For using lua.

15% For having a good makefile/exe.

15% Advanced texturing and game design.

10% For git usage.

10% For documentation.

5% Our panache.
